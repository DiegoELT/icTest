# Web Developer Test - InterConnecta

## About
At InterConnecta we work on a daily basis with CRMs. These are platforms with databases that store people, company, and transactional information.

These platforms, like many other applications we use, have an API that can be used to extract their data. That is your objective today!

## The Test

### Objective
Create a simple web interface that obtains all Lead records from Zoho CRM via their API and then presents them to the user on a table.

### Objectives
There are four objectives which we'll use to qualify you. Let's see how many you can complete:

1. Obtain Data
    - Use Zoho CRM's API v1 to obtain the first 100 Lead records

2. Put the data in a table
    - The table must contain the followin columns:
        + First Name
        + Last Name
        + Email

3. Make it Accessible
    - Create a simple interface where a button obtains the data and then displays it in the table

4. Upload it
    - Publish the project to a GitHub account
    - Send us a link with the repository

### Environment
- We recommend using entirely JavaScript but feel free to mix it up with PHP.
- Bonus points for using a JS framework such as Vue.js, React, or Angular.

## Documentation
- Zoho CRM Authorization Token will be provided during the test.
